This is a fullstack social media app. Here you can share technical experience and knowledge.It uses react.js for the frontend and node.js, express.js and mongodb for the backend.
The node api, which allows the frontend and Database to communicate, has validation, authentication, cors and cookies-support.It also has an opportunity to upload images with multer.The authentication is powered by jwt tokens and becrypt. To display this app in your browser you have to include a mongodb-uri in /backend/.env-sample and a random jwt signature.**After that rename the file to .env**.Finally you can run the client and backend seperatly using npm start.<br /><br /><br />
